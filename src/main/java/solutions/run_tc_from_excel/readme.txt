Problem Stmt:
We have an excel which contains all the scenario to be executed one by one
Key is page name
Value is action to be done on page
All action separated by arrow


Sol1: Basic solution is to read excel and based on value execute code on UI

Sol2: Better solution will be to read all excel in one go and convert it into POJOs
 And later play with java object as it has all the details of excel

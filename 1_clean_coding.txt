#Clean Coding:
todo: https://www.codingdojo.com/blog/clean-code-techniques

1. Local Var:  The best place to make local variable is where we have to use them. Shd have min scope.
2. Loops:  Try to use for-each loop over normal for loop and iterator to iterate an array or collection.
	       for-each has many adv specially in case of nested loops.
3. Money:  Never use float and double to money related calculation. Use BigDecimal.    -- NEED EXAMPLE
4. Primitives:  Always try to use Primitive over Boxed Primitive(Integer,Long,Boolean etc) wherever possible
5. Utilities:
	a. A utility class should always have a private constructor, so that no object can be created in class.
	b. A utility class should not have any class level variables, all variables should be local to methods
	 otherwise it can impact other codes.

6. Short Method Body:
	a. Extract code to a new method if code is getting longer than 4-5 lines	
	b. Important method should have bare mini code, all other code shd extract to new method
	c. try block shd have one row ideally   -- NEED EXAMPLE

7. Naming: 
	a. method name is very imp and shd suite to particular functionality
	b. Any user defined constant or string shd be made as constant with proper meaningful name

8. Boolean Parameter: If a method accept boolean param means it will do two things in if else loop. So better make two different method
   and remove the boolean value. Code will be better readable and easy to understand.
  
9. Use Instant.now().plusSeconds(1L) rather Thread.sleep()
